# Awodi
_Awodi_ is Micro Aerial Vehicle made with a PCB frame, having a combination of  an  on - board  position sensor and an  Arduino  for implementing and testing control strategies. Designed and constructed by [@jimiolaniyan](https://github.com/jimiolaniyan) and [@demukpere](https://github.com/demukpere), it is a modification of [this instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/PCB-Quadrotor-Brushless/?ALLSTEPS) by [Shane Colton](http://scolton.blogspot.com/).

This drone also has a voice-activation feature whereby the drone can be commanded through voice inputs to an android device that are sent over a wireless network using xbees.

## Poster Presentation
The [abstract](https://github.com/jimiolaniyan/Awodi/blob/master/docs/abstract.pdf) for this work has been accepted for the [2016 University of Lagos Research Conference and Fair](http://conference.unilag.edu.ng/) and we will be giving a poster presentation at the conference. See details [here](http://conference.unilag.edu.ng/)
## Extending Capabilities
Future modifications are targetted at modifying the platform to become autonomous by adding a camera for vision and navigation.
